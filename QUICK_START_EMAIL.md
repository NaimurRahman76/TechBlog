This guide will help you quickly set up and test the email validation feature.

## Step 1: Run Database Migration

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd f:\My projects\CascadeProjects\windsurf-project\TechBlog

# Create and apply migration
dotnet ef migrations add AddEmailSettingsAndVerification --project src/TechBlog.Web
dotnet ef database update --project src/TechBlog.Web
```

## Step 2: Run the Application

The application will start at `https://localhost:5001` (or the configured port).

## Step 3: Login to Admin Panel

1. Navigate to `https://localhost:5001/Admin`
2. Login with admin credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@techblog.com`
   - **Password**: `Admin@123` (or your configured admin password)

## Step 4: Configure Email Settings

1. Click **Email Settings** in the admin sidebar
2. Fill in your SMTP settings:

### For Gmail (Recommended for Testing):

```

### Getting Gmail App Password:

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** if not already enabled
3. Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
4. Select **Mail** and **Windows Computer** (or Other)
5. Click **Generate**
6. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
7. Use this password in the Email Settings

## Step 5: Test Email Configuration

1. In the Email Settings page, click **Send Test Email**
2. Enter your email address
3. Click **Send Test Email**
4. Check your inbox for the test email

✅ If you receive the email, your configuration is correct!

## Step 6: Test User Registration

1. **Logout** from admin account
2. Go to `https://localhost:5001/Identity/Account/Register`
3. Fill in the registration form:
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Email: testuser@example.com (use a real email you can access)
   - Password: Test@123
   - Confirm Password: Test@123
4. Click **Register**

## Step 7: Verify Email

1. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
2. You should receive an email with subject: **"Verify Your Email Address - TechBlog"**
3. Click the **Verify Email Address** button in the email
4. You'll be redirected to the confirmation page
5. You'll be automatically signed in

🎉 **Success!** Email validation is now working!

## Testing Resend Functionality

1. Register a new user but don't click the verification link
2. Go to `https://localhost:5001/Identity/Account/ResendEmailConfirmation`
3. Enter the email address
4. Click **Resend Confirmation Email**
5. Check your inbox for the new verification email

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Failed to send test email"

**Check:**
- SMTP host and port are correct
- Username and password are correct
- SSL/TLS is enabled
- Your firewall allows outbound SMTP traffic
- For Gmail: You're using an App Password, not your regular password

### ❌ "Email not received"

**Check:**
- Spam/Junk folder
- Email address is correct
- Email service is enabled in settings
- Check application logs for errors

### ❌ "Verification link expired"

**Solution:**
- Go to Resend Email Confirmation page
- Enter your email
- Get a new verification link

### ❌ Gmail "Less secure apps" error

**Solution:**
- Gmail no longer supports "less secure apps"
- You MUST use an App Password
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication first

## Alternative Email Providers

### Using Outlook/Office 365:

```
SMTP Host: smtp.office365.com
SMTP Port: 587
Enable SSL: ✓
Username: your-email@outlook.com
Password: your-password
```

### Using SendGrid (Recommended for Production):

1. Sign up at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Create an API Key
3. Configure:

```
SMTP Host: smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP Port: 587
Enable SSL: ✓
Username: apikey
Password: your-sendgrid-api-key
```

## Disabling Email Verification (For Testing)

If you want to test without email verification:

1. Go to **Admin > Email Settings**
2. Uncheck **Enable Email Verification**
3. Click **Save Settings**

Users will now be automatically confirmed upon registration.

## Production Recommendations

### 🔒 Security

1. **Use environment variables** for SMTP credentials:
   ```json
   // appsettings.Production.json
   {
     "EmailSettings": {
       "Password": "#{SMTP_PASSWORD}#"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use a dedicated email service** (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES)
3. **Enable SSL/TLS** always
4. **Monitor email delivery** rates

### 📧 Deliverability

1. **Configure SPF records** for your domain
2. **Set up DKIM signing**
3. **Use a professional from address** (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com)
4. **Monitor bounce rates**

### 🎯 User Experience

1. **Set reasonable expiration** (24-48 hours)
2. **Provide clear instructions** in emails
3. **Make resend easy** to find
4. **Test on mobile devices**

## Next Steps
